Instructions for Packagers
--------------------------

Packagers create RPM or deb files for Linux distributions.  If you are a
normal user, please skip this section.

Packaging PSSH is pretty straightforward.  Just do a setup.py install, and
then move usr/bin/pssh-askpass to usr/libexec/pssh/pssh-askpass.  Although
having pssh-askpass in /usr/bin doesn't really hurt anything, it's not
necessary, so it's cleaner to move it to /usr/libexec.
