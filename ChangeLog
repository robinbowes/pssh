2009-10-20 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.0
	  - Rewrote communication code to be more efficient.  PSSH now
	    operates with only one or two threads.
	  - Added the ability to interrupt PSSH (with CTRL-c).
	  - Added an option to prompt for a password.
	  - Refactored code into a distinct library (psshlib).
2008-10-12 Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.3
	  - Fixed bug in select_wrap.  If timeout is None (e.g., the
	    default for prsync, etc.), then never time out.  Bug reported
	    by Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon (carenas at sajinet.com.pe).
	  - Catch getopt exceptions and print usage as well as getopt
	    exception string.  Contribution from Carlo Marcelo Arenas
	    Belon (carenas at sajinet.com.pe).
	  - Added contribution from Bas van der Vlies (basv at sara.nl)
	    to allow comments in hosts file.  Comments must begin with
	    # character (leading whitespace is also allowed).
	  - Restore file status bugs after reading stdin in pssh.
	  - Fixed typo bug in pslurp when using options and in
	    non-recursive mode.
	  - Removed conflicts with built-in names.
2008-09-01 Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.2
	  - Fixed minor bug: select returns select.error on an error,
	    not OSError.
2008-08-27 Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.1
	  - Removed broken SIGCHLD handler.
	  - Refining subprocess _cleanup dynamically to an empty lambda
	    function since subprocess is not thread-safe and we already
	    call wait on child processes ourselves anyway.
	  - Adding missing verbose flag to rest of bin/* programs.
2008-08-24  Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.0
	  - Fixed 64-bit bug in pslurp, pscp, prsync.  Previously, the
	    default select timeout was sys.maxint, but this is a 64-bit
	    value on 64-machines. Now using None when calling select when
	    there is no timeout.  Bug reported by (buixor at gmail.com).
	  - Catching EINTR and ignoring it for select, read, write in
	    BaseThread class.
	  - Fixed longopts for pnuke, prsync, pscp, pslurp, pssh (bug
	    reported a Debian user via Andrew Pollock (apollock at
	    debian.org)).
	    Reference: "bug #481901: pssh: options mis-specified"
	  - Added missing environment variables for options for pnuke,
	    prsync, pscp, pslurp, pssh.
